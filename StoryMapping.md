# Story Mapping

## BHAG:
You are the best fighter pilot on Earth and you’ve been asked to go on a mission to protect Earth from Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms (MUTO) sent by Dr. Posnett using weapons on your Falcon 3000.

## Epic Stories:
1. As a pilot, I want to shoot down all the MUTO’s before they reach planet Earth while avoiding their missiles.
2. As MUTO, we want to destroy the Falcon 3000 using our missiles.
3. As MUTO, we want to reach planet Earth.
4. As a pilot, I can protect myself by hiding behind the 4 defense bunkers.
5. As a game developer, I want to make the GUI for the game.
