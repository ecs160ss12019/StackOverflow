## BHAG:
Dr. Posnett, a Russian hacker, designed infected versions of many popular applications. Some poor kids downloaded these applications from his website. These malware applications carries numbers of lethal viruses and tries to overflow the system memory. Thank god these kids have installed the powerful antivirus software, Phoenix 3000. You as Phoenix 3000 must terminate all malware processors using physical signals before they take over the memory. You should be careful from those viruses, they can infect the system and terminate Phoenix 3000.

## Epic Stories:
As a Phoenix 3000, I want to shut down all the malware applications before they take over the memory while avoiding attacks from their viruses.<br />
As a malware application, I can use viruses to infect the system and kill the Phoenix 3000. <br />
As a malware application, I want to takeover the entire memory space, the more depth we reach, the more system memory will be taken over. <br />
As a Phoenix 3000, I can protect myself from viruses by hiding behind 4 defense firewalls that protect the system. <br />
As a game developer, I want to make the GUI for the game. <br />
