### BHAG:
Dr. Posnett, a Russian hacker, designed infected versions of many popular applications. Some poor kids downloaded these applications from his website. These malware applications carries numbers of lethal viruses and tries to overflow the system memory. Thank god these kids have installed the powerful antivirus software, Phoenix 3000. You as Phoenix 3000 must terminate all malware processors using physical signals before they take over the memory. You should be careful from those viruses, they can infect the system and terminate Phoenix 3000.
